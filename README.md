The plasticity mechanism keyboard demonstration is located in the scripts folder. It has been tested on python version 3.6

To try it out first install dependancies:

You will have to run it with sudo to allow keyboard access. If you are using a Mac, you may be prompted to allow  permissions for Terminal in the accessabiilty section of your privacy settings. 

If you are in the root folder of this repository simply type the following into your terminal window:

$ sudo python scripts/plastic_mech_keyboard.py

A new window will pop up with a live animation graphing your current neophilic threshold.

To exit the program, simply press q at any time. 

This demonstration is sped up by a factor of 10 for improved illustrative purposes
